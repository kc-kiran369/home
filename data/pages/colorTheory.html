				<h2 id="section1">Understanding color</h2>
				<p>Color is perception. Our eyes see something (the sky, for example), and data sent from our eyes to our brains tells us it’s a certain color (blue). Objects reflect light in different combinations of wavelengths. Our brains pick up on those wavelength combinations and translate them into the phenomenon we call color.</p>
				<p>People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based solely on color. So, a very important part of your branding must focus on color.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section2">RGB: the additive color mixing model</h2>
				<img src="../images/colorTheory/pic1.jpg">
				<p>Humans see colors in light waves. Mixing light—or the additive color mixing model—allows you to create colors by mixing red, green and blue light sources of various intensities. The more light you add, the brighter the color mix becomes. If you mix all three colors of light, you get pure, white light.

				TVs, screens and projectors use red, green and blue (RGB) as their primary colors, and then mix them together to create other colors.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section3">Why should you care?</h2>
				<p>Let’s say you have a very distinct brand with a bright yellow logo. If you post the logo on Facebook, Twitter or your website and don’t use the correct color process, your logo will appear muddy instead of that bright yellow. That’s why, when working with files for any screen, use RGB, not CMYK.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section4">The color wheel</h2>
				<img src="../images/colorTheory/pic2.png">
				<p>Understanding the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t and how color communicates) is just as exciting as that new box of crayons. No really.

				Being able to understand the terms and processes that go along with color will help you knowledgeably communicate your vision with your designer, printer, or even (maybe) an Apple Store Genius.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section5">Color wheel basics</h2>
				<img src="../images/colorTheory/pic3.jpg">
				<p>The first color wheel was designed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666 so it absolutely predates your introduction to it in kindergarten. Artists and designers still use it to develop color harmonies, mixing and palettes.

				The color wheel consists of three primary colors (red, yellow, blue), three secondary colors (colors created when primary colors are mixed: green, orange, purple) and six tertiary colors (colors made from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>
				<p>Warm colors are generally associated with energy, brightness, and action, whereas cool colors are often identified with calm, peace, and serenity.

				When you recognize that color has a temperature, you can understand how choosing all warm or all cool colors in a logo or on your website can impact your message.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section6">Some Color schemes</h2>
	
				<h2 id="section7">Complementary colors</h2>
				<img src="../images/colorTheory/pic4.png">
				<p>Complementary colors are opposites on the color wheel—red and green, for example.Because there’s a sharp contrast between the two colors, they can really make imagery pop, but overusing them can get tiresome. Think any shopping mall in December. That being said, using a complementary color scheme in your business marketing offers sharp contrast and clear differentiation between images.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section8">Analogous colors</h2>
				<img src="../images/colorTheory/pic5.jpg">
				<p>Analogous colors sit next to one another on the color wheel—red, orange and yellow, for example. When creating an analogous color scheme, one color will dominate, one will support and another will accent. In business, analogous color schemes are not only pleasing to the eye, but can effectively instruct the consumer where and how to take action</p>
	
				<h2 id="section9">Monochromatic color</h2>
				<img src="../images/colorTheory/pic6.png">
				<p>A monochromatic color scheme is a one-color scheme that is created using different tones of that one color. Once you have chosen your base color, you can use a color wheel to help you choose different hues of that same color, varying the saturation and tone of the base color to pick out lighter and darker hues.</p>
