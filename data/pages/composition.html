				<h2 id="section1">What is Composition?</h2>
				<p>The term composition means "putting together". It can be thought of as the organization of the elements of art according to the principles of art. Composition can apply to any work of art, from music through writing and into photography, that is arranged using conscious thought.</p>
				<p>Composition is how the elements of a photo are arranged. A composition 	can me made up of many different elements, or only a few. It's how the 	artist puts those things within a frame that help a photograph become more 	or less interesting to the viewer.
	
				A good photograph will take many different parts and combine them into an 	aesthetically pleasing whole. Composition is how an artist tells a story 	within the confines of a single frame.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section2">Why is Composition Important in Photography?</h2>
				<p>How many times have you seen a photograph that seemed to be taken in an 	amazing location with an incredible subject, but the image didn't do much 	for you? The problem very well might be that the composition was off.
	
				Composition is everything when it comes to a photograph. Oftentimes, the 	technical side of an image is pretty easy to learn, so the one thing that 	separates a great image from one that is less interesting is the 	composition.  
	
				Everyone has a camera these days, so how you are able to visually capture 	something that is also being photographed by the masses right alongside 	you will help to distinguish your work from other photographers. 	Hopefully, this will gain you the success or business you seek. </p>
	
				<h2 id="section3">Composition Concepts and Principles</h2>
	
				<h2 id="section4">Rule of Thirds</h2>
				<img src="../images/composition/pic1.jpg">
				<p>In rule of third the photo is separated into 3 equal segments. The Rule 	of Thirds uses key intersection points and breaks the scene up into thirds 	vertically and horizontally. In the grid where these lines intersect are 	the points where you should try to put your main subjects.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section5">Golden Spiral</h2>
				<img src="../images/composition/pic2.jpg">
				<p>The golden spiral is another method that people often use to compose a 	shot. A curve starts from the corners and goes across the upper portion of 	the frame, spiralling towards the middle and the bottom. The concept is 	that movement and subjects should all fall on the curve and your most 	interesting portion of the frame should align closely with the middle of 	the spiral in the lower quadrant of the frame.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section6">Golden Triangles</h2>
				<img src="../images/composition/pic3.jpg">
				<p>Golden Triangles are yet another composition technique that 	photographers use to break the scene up and put emphasis on certain areas 	of the frame. This involves drawing a diagonal line from one corner to the 	other of the image, and then from that line, two more lines come from the 	remaining corners to connect them together. Where the shorter lines touch 	the larger middle line are the areas where the most interesting parts of 	your composition should be lined up. </p>
	
				<h2 id="section7">Natural Framing</h2>
				<img src="../images/composition/pic4.jpg">
				<p>Once you find your subject, you can look for ways to frame that subject 	within the image. Maybe there are some trees that can bend around the 	subject, or a hole in a wall or rock that you can use to make an 	interesting frame. Perhaps you can even utilise parts of a wall or old 	buildings to create a frame around a subject. </p>
	
				<h2 id="section8">Symmetry</h2>
				<img src="../images/composition/pic5.jpg">
				<p>In photography symmetry appears when parts of your composition mirror 	other parts. It is created when two halves of your scene look the same and 	balance each other out. Symmetry defines something being clean, 	proportional and balanced and will make pictures appear neat, tidy and 	clinical.</p>
	
				<h2 id="section9">Leading lines</h2>
				<img src="../images/composition/pic6.jpg">
				<p>
					Leading lines are lines that appear in a photograph that have been 	framed and positioned by the photographer to draw the viewer's eye 	towards a specific point of interest. These lines often draw the 	viewer's eye in a specific direction or towards a designated portion 	of the photograph.
